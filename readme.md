basic python script for obs to add qol things for replay buffer use.

things currently in

- replay buffer enabled on startup 
- makes a sound when you save a replay

things I might add later

- visual popup when you save a replay (like nvidia and amd's instant replay)
- open obs in the tray on pc startup (not sure if this is possible)
- ui setting to change the audio without having to manually change the file
