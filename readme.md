basic python script for obs to add qol things for replay buffer use.


### usage
1. download code 
2. put the contents of the "src" file in "(your path to obs)\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit"
3. open obs, go to tools -> scripts
4. select python settings, and give it the path to your interpreter
5. go to scripts, navigate to the path in step 2, and select replaybufferqol.py
6. his the reload button in the bottom right or restart obs
7. should work :thumbs_up:



### things currently in

- replay buffer enabled on startup 
- makes a sound when you save a replay

### things I might add later

- visual popup when you save a replay (like nvidia and amd's instant replay)
- open obs in the tray on pc startup (not sure if this is possible fully possible)
- ui setting to change the audio without having to manually change the file
